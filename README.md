[OFFLINE RPS] This is my entry into Weekly Game Jam Week 154 - Theme: Rock Paper Scissors.

**Game Description**

This is a 2D endless runner based off of the offline dinosaur game from Chrome. Player controls a pair of scissors that are "running" and they have to jump to dodge rocks on the ground while also avoiding the paper airplanes that are flying overhead.


The game will be published on itch.io as a WebGL game playable in browser.  https://csquared44.itch.io/rock-paper-scissors-offline-edition
