[OFFLINE RPS] This is my entry into Weekly Game Jam Week 154 - Theme: Rock Paper Scissors.

**Game Description**

This is a simple 2D endless runner imitating the offline browser game from Chrome, with the assets in line with the jam theme. Player controls a pair of scissors that are "running" and they have to jump to dodge rocks on the ground while also avoiding the paper airplanes that are flying overhead.


The game will be published on itch.io as a WebGL game with a downloadable option for Mac.
